# Hermes
## About
Hermes was a project developed during HackGT6. The goal was to simplify the checkout process at retail locations by streamlining
the reward system. The main idea was to use facial recognition at checkout to identify the customer and automatically give them the
appropriate reward points for their purchase.
## How It Works
By utilizing Amazon Web Service's Rekognition library, face detection was make easy. Through a combined use of Python and SQL user accounts
are made and recognized.
